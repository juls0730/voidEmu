# VoidEmu

Current state: This project is a Chip8 emulator implemented according to [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#2.2).

This is a simple emulator for the Game Boy. It is written in C++ and uses SDL for rendering.

## Why

I wanted to learn how to use C++ and SDL, and I recently saw a youtube video listing out reasons for writing a Game Boy emulator. The name is VoidEmu, because I gurantee I will be staring into the void trying to make this thing work.
